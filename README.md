## Visualization of PDFs
Visualizing PDFs directly within a GitHub repository can be challenging, as GitHub typically renders only text-based files by default. However, you can use the following methods to visualize PDFs:
1. **Preview PDFs locally:** Download the PDF files from the repository and view them using a PDF viewer application installed on your local machine.
2. **Online PDF viewers:** Upload the PDF files to online PDF viewers like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Adobe Document Cloud, and share the viewing links in the repository README.
3. **Convert to images:** Convert the PDF pages to images using tools like Adobe Acrobat or online PDF to image converters. You can then include these images in the README or create a separate folder for image previews.
4. **Embed PDFs:** Use third-party services that allow embedding PDFs, such as Embedly or Scribd, to embed PDF previews directly into your README.
